# Snake Game using Pygame Library

# Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pygame library

# Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install pygame

# How to Play
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the snake_game.py file:
python snake_game.py
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.
Eat the food pellets (red squares) to grow longer.
Avoid colliding with the boundaries of the screen or the snake itself.

# Features
Snake grows longer upon eating food.
Game speed increases as the snake grows.
Score counter to track points gained by eating food.
Game over screen with the option to play again.

# Files Included
snake_game.py: Main Python script containing the game logic.
assets/: Directory containing game assets (images, sounds, etc.).
README.md: Markdown file providing information about the project.
Acknowledgments
