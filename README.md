# Snake Game using Pygame Library

Snake Game Created by @mr.hariom_chaudhary using Python and pygame library


# Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.

# Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x

2. Pygame library


# Installation

i. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

ii. Install the required dependencies using pip:

iii. pip install pygame


# How to Play

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the snake_game.py file:

4. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.

5. Eat the food pellets (red circles) to grow longer.

6. Avoid colliding with the boundaries of the screen or the snake itself.


# Features

i. Snake grows longer upon eating food.

ii. Score counter to track points gained by eating food.
